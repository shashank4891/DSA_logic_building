## Pattern Series for DSA

Welcome to the Pattern Series repository! This repository contains a collection of important pattern problems that we should solve before starting Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Patterns are fundamental in building strong problem-solving skills and logical thinking. 

## Patterns Included

This repository includes solutions to various pattern problems, provided in both Python and JavaScript. Each problem is solved with detailed code examples in both languages.

### List of Patterns

1. **Pattern 1**
   - **Description**: Prints a rectangular pattern of stars.
   - **Languages**: Python, JavaScript

2. **Pattern 2**
   - **Description**: Prints a right-angled triangle of stars where the number of stars increases with each row.
   - **Languages**: Python, JavaScript

3. **Pattern 3**
   - **Description**: Prints a right-angled triangle with numbers, where each row contains numbers from 1 to the row number.
   - **Languages**: Python, JavaScript

4. **Pattern 4**
   - **Description**: Prints a right-angled triangle with repeated numbers, where each row contains the row number itself.
   - **Languages**: Python, JavaScript

5. **Pattern 5**
   - **Description**: Prints an inverted right-angled triangle of stars, where the number of stars decreases with each row.
   - **Languages**: Python, JavaScript

6. **Pattern 6**
   - **Description**: Prints an inverted pyramid with numbers.
   - **Languages**: Python, JavaScript

7. **Pattern 7**
   - **Description**: Prints a diamond shape pattern with stars.
   - **Languages**: Python, JavaScript

## Run the Code

- **For Python**: Use the command `python <filename>.py`
- **For JavaScript**: Use Node.js with the command `node <filename>.js`
